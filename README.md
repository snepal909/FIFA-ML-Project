## FIFA Soccer Machine Learning

#### The goal of this project was to attempt to create a model that predicts the real results of football/soccer teams among Europe's top 5 leagues, based on the player ratings of those teams within the FIFA video game franchise.

#### The FIFA ML Project.ipynb contains the notebook with all the code, markdown information, and comments accordingly. To see the results of each cell you can just run through the program in order. Currently the code typed in is pretty rough as this was my first machine learning project to try and get into coding for data science. It will be constantly improved over time. It is also currently a work in progress, so please keep that in mind. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy and obtain some knowledge after going through my experiment. All other files used are found in the root folder of the repo.
